		<p class="verse">Verse</p>
		<p class="verse">
		I've been reading books of old
		The legends and the myths
		Achilles and his gold
		Hercules and his gifts
		Spiderman's control
		And Batman with his fists
		And clearly I don't see myself upon that list
		</p>
		<p class="verse">Verse</p>
		<p class="verse">
		But she said, where'd you wanna go?
		How much you wanna risk?
		I'm not looking for somebody
		With some superhuman gifts
		Some superhero
		Some fairytale bliss
		Just something I can turn to
		Somebody I can kiss
		</p>

		<p class="chorus">Chorus</p>
		<p class="chorus">
		I want something just like this
		Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
		Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
		Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo</p>

		<p class="chorus">Oh, I want something just like this
		Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
		Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
		Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo</p>

		<p class="chorus">Oh, I want something just like this
		I want something just like this</p>


		<p class="verse">Verse</p>
		<p class="verse">
		I've been reading books of old
		The legends and the myths
		The testaments they told
		The moon and its eclipse
		And Superman unrolls
		A suit before he lifts
		But I'm not the kind of person that it fits
		</p>


		<p class="verse">Verse</p>
		<p class="verse">
		She said, where'd you wanna go?
		How much you wanna risk?
		I'm not looking for somebody
		With some superhuman gifts
		Some superhero
		Some fairytale bliss
		Just something I can turn to
		Somebody I can miss
		</p>

		<p class="chorus">Chorus</p>
		<p class="chorus">I want something just like this
		I want something just like this</p>

		<p class="chorus">Oh, I want something just like this
		Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
		Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
		Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo</p>

		<p class="chorus">Oh, I want something just like this
		Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
		Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo
		Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo</p>
